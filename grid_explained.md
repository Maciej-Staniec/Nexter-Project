## Understanding `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(20rem, 1fr))`

The CSS property `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(20rem, 1fr));` is a powerful way to create flexible and responsive grid layouts. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

### `grid-template-columns`

This property defines the columns of a grid container, specifying the number and size of the columns.

### `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(20rem, 1fr))`

This value combines several CSS functions to create a dynamic column layout:

#### `repeat()`

- **`repeat(auto-fill, ...)`**: This keyword fills the container with as many columns as possible without overflowing. The number of columns adjusts automatically if the container's size changes.

#### `minmax()`

- **`minmax(20rem, 1fr)`**: This function defines a size range for each column:
  - **`20rem` (minimum size)**: Each column will be at least `20rem` wide. (1 `rem` is typically 16 pixels, so 20 `rem` is 320 pixels.)
  - **`1fr` (maximum size)**: Each column can grow to fill the remaining space equally. The `fr` unit stands for "fraction."


### How It Works

- **Flexible Columns**: The grid container will create as many columns as can fit within its width, each being at least `20rem` wide.
- **Responsive Layout**: If the container's width changes, the number of columns adjusts dynamically, ensuring each column is at least `20rem` wide while sharing the remaining space equally.

This approach is excellent for responsive designs, ensuring a minimum column size for readability while allowing the layout to adapt to various screen sizes.
